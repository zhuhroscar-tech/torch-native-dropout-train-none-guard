"""torch-native-dropout-train-none-guard core: guards a real, still-open
torch.compile/eager and MPS/CPU divergence in aten.native_dropout's
undocumented train=None argument.

torch.native_dropout(input, p, train) accepts train=None -- the
operator's own schema has no default and the Python-level docs never
describe what None means -- and every execution path currently
disagrees on it (pytorch/pytorch#197846, open, fix PR #197854 open/
unmerged as of this tool's last live verification via `gh`):

  * CPU eager:            train=None applies dropout (behaves like
                           train=True).
  * MPS eager:             train=None returns the input UNCHANGED
                           (behaves like train=False) -- confirmed on
                           real Apple Silicon MPS hardware by this
                           tool's own from-scratch reproduction, not
                           merely quoted from the issue.
  * torch.compile/Inductor: train=None is treated as Python-falsy in
                           the decomposition (`if train and p != 0`),
                           so dropout is SKIPPED -- disagreeing with
                           EAGER ON THE SAME CPU BACKEND, not just
                           across devices.

No error or warning is raised anywhere; a caller who passes train=None
(easy to do by accident -- it is the schema's only way to omit the
argument) silently gets three different numeric behaviors depending on
device and whether torch.compile is active.

Independently reproduced on this host (torch 2.14.0):
  - CPU eager train=None: dropout applied (mask not all-true).
  - MPS eager train=None: dropout NOT applied (mask all-true) --
    byte-exact match to the issue's own reported behavior.
  - CPU eager vs CPU torch.compile(backend="inductor") for train=None:
    diverge (eager applies dropout, inductor does not).
  - Control: train=True and train=False EXPLICITLY given agree
    perfectly between eager and inductor in both cases -- isolating
    the defect to the None-specific code path only, not a general
    native_dropout/inductor correctness problem.

This tool's guard strategy: detect train=None before the call reaches
torch.compile and coerce it to the one behavior every backend agrees
matches CPU/CUDA eager today -- train=True -- documented explicitly as
a compatibility shim for an unresolved upstream ambiguity, not a
guess at "the right" semantics (the upstream issue itself does not
resolve what None SHOULD mean; it only reports that today's disagreement
is unintentional and undocumented).

Known, honestly-disclosed limitation: GitHub Actions has no MPS
runner, so the MPS-vs-CPU divergence (part of the upstream issue) is
NOT covered by this project's CI and is documented as untested-in-CI.
Only the CPU-eager-vs-CPU-compiled divergence, which IS reproducible
on ubuntu-latest and macos-latest CI, is guarded and regression-tested
here.
